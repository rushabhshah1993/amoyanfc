## Data Structure

### Title Entry Format

Each championship is recorded in the fighter's `competitionHistory.titles` object:

```json
{
  "competitionId": "6778103309a4c4b25127f8fc",
  "titles": {
    "totalTitles": 2,
    "details": [
      {
        "competitionSeasonId": "68f51cf313d57b6372013fd5",
        "seasonNumber": 3,
        "divisionNumber": null
      },
      {
        "competitionSeasonId": "68f51ddf7963650c76b115c0",
        "seasonNumber": 4,
        "divisionNumber": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Key Fields

- **`competitionSeasonId`**: MongoDB ObjectId of the specific IC season competition
- **`seasonNumber`**: The season number (1, 2, 3, or 4)
- **`divisionNumber`**: `null` for cup competitions (IC fighters come from all divisions)

## IC Season Mapping

The script used the following competition season IDs:

| Season | Competition MongoDB ID            |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| 1      | `68f508e05b3c2537134030e9`       |
| 2      | `68f51be7f39401ab6de7a23e`       |
| 3      | `68f51cf313d57b6372013fd5`       |
| 4      | `68f51ddf7963650c76b115c0`       |

## How It Works

### Detection Logic

The script:
1. Fetches all IC competition seasons from MongoDB
2. Creates a mapping of season numbers to competition IDs
3. Finds all fighters with IC participation
4. Identifies champions by checking `finalCupPosition === "Champion"`
5. Adds title entries with:
   - `competitionSeasonId`: The MongoDB ID of that season
   - `seasonNumber`: The season number
   - `divisionNumber`: `null` (for cups)
6. Updates `totalTitles` count
7. Saves the fighter record

### Duplicate Prevention

The script checks for existing titles before adding new ones to prevent duplicates. It matches on:
- `seasonNumber`
- `competitionSeasonId`

## Verification Results

All three IC champions were verified:

### Sayali Raut ‚úÖ
- Championships: 2 (Seasons 3, 4)
- Titles Recorded: 2
- Match: YES

### Ishita Shah ‚úÖ
- Championships: 1 (Season 2)
- Titles Recorded: 1
- Match: YES

### Tanvi Shah ‚úÖ
- Championships: 1 (Season 1)
- Titles Recorded: 1
- Match: YES

---

## Frontend Display

With this update, the CompetitionHistory component will now show:

```
Invicta Cup
üèÜ 2x Champion ‚Ä¢ S3, S4 (for Sayali Raut)
```

Or:

```
Invicta Cup
üèÜ 1x Champion ‚Ä¢ S2 (for Ishita Shah)
```

**Note:** The frontend `formatTitles` function currently displays division numbers for all titles. You may want to update it to handle cup competitions (where `divisionNumber` is `null`) differently.

## Comparison with League Competitions

### League (IFC/IFL)
```json
{
  "competitionSeasonId": "...",
  "seasonNumber": 6,
  "divisionNumber": 1  // Division 1, 2, or 3
}
```

### Cup (IC/CC)
```json
{
  "competitionSeasonId": "...",
  "seasonNumber": 3,
  "divisionNumber": null  // null for cups
}
```

---

## Next Steps

### For Champions Cup
When you're ready to update Champions Cup titles, you can:
1. Copy the `update-ic-titles.js` script
2. Change the competition meta ID to Champions Cup
3. Update the season numbers array
4. Run the script

### Frontend Enhancement (Optional)
Consider updating `CompetitionHistory.tsx` to handle cup titles differently:
- Don't show division numbers for cup titles (they're null)
- Format as: "2x Champion ‚Ä¢ S3, S4" instead of "2x Champion ‚Ä¢ S3 (Division null)"

---

## Important Notes

- ‚úÖ All titles have `divisionNumber: null` (correct for cup competitions)
- ‚úÖ Script is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- ‚úÖ Existing titles are not duplicated
- ‚úÖ All changes verified and confirmed

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED

All Invicta Cup champions now have their titles properly recorded! üèÜ
