## Streak Calculation Logic

### Chronological Processing

1. **Fetch all IC fights** across all seasons
2. **Sort fights** chronologically:
   - By season number (1, 2, 3, 4)
   - By round number within season (R1=1, SF=2, FN=3)
3. **For each fighter:**
   - Process fights in order
   - Track consecutive wins or losses
   - Start new streak when result type changes
   - Mark previous streak as ended

### Example: Ishita Shah's Streak Progression

```
Season 2, R1:  Win  → Start win streak (count: 1)
Season 2, SF:  Win  → Continue (count: 2)
Season 2, FN:  Win  → Continue (count: 3) 🏆 Champion
Season 3, R1:  Win  → Continue (count: 4)
Season 3, SF:  Win  → Continue (count: 5)
Season 3, FN:  Lose → End win streak, start lose streak (count: 1)
```

**Result:** 2 streaks
- Win streak: 5 fights (ended)
- Lose streak: 1 fight (active)

## Comparison: League vs Cup Streaks

### League Streaks (IFC/IFL)
```json
{
  "start": {
    "season": 6,
    "division": 1,    // Division 1, 2, or 3
    "round": 1
  },
  "end": {
    "season": 6,
    "division": 1,
    "round": 5
  }
}
```

### Cup Streaks (IC/CC)
```json
{
  "start": {
    "season": 3,
    "division": null,  // null for cups
    "round": 1
  },
  "end": {
    "season": 4,
    "division": null,
    "round": 3
  }
}
```

**Key Difference:** Cup streaks have `division: null` and can span multiple seasons since fighters don't have a fixed division in cups.

---

## Active vs Ended Streaks

### Active Streaks (23 total)
- Every IC fighter has exactly one active streak
- Active streak represents their most recent IC result pattern
- Will continue if they participate in future IC seasons

### Ended Streaks (16 total)
- Streaks that changed type (win → lose or lose → win)
- Provide historical context of fighter's IC journey
- Important for analyzing performance patterns

---

## Streak Distribution

### By Count
| Count | Win Streaks | Lose Streaks |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 fight | 10 | 24 |
| 2 fights | 2 | 1 |
| 3 fights | 1 | 0 |
| 5 fights | 1 | 0 |
| 6 fights | 1 | 0 |

**Observations:**
- Most streaks are 1 fight (tournament eliminations)
- Longest streaks belong to champions
- Few fighters maintain long IC streaks due to knockout format

---

## Technical Details

### Round Number Mapping
```javascript
function getRoundNumber(fightIdentifier) {
  if (fightIdentifier.includes('-R1-')) return 1;  // Quarter-finals

  if (a.season !== b.season) return a.season - b.season;
  return a.round - b.round;
});
```

## Data Integrity Verification

### Checks Performed

1. ✅ **Sample Fighters:** Verified 4 fighters with different participation levels
2. ✅ **Streak Counts:** All match expected patterns
3. ✅ **Total Fights:** Sum of all streak counts = total IC fights per fighter
4. ✅ **Active Status:** Each fighter has exactly one active streak
5. ✅ **Opponent Lists:** All opponents recorded in streaks
6. ✅ **Chronological Order:** Streaks follow correct fight sequence

### Results

| Verification | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Fighters with Streaks | 23/23 ✅ |
| Data Consistency | 100% ✅ |
| Active Streaks | 23/23 ✅ |
| Fight Count Match | 100% ✅ |
| Longest Win Streak | 6 (Sayali) ✅ |

## Important Notes

- ✅ Script is idempotent (checks for existing streaks)
- ✅ Only adds new IC streaks
- ✅ Preserves existing streak data for other competitions
- ✅ Handles multi-season streaks correctly
- ✅ Proper chronological ordering
- ✅ Active status correctly maintained

## Next Steps

### For Champions Cup (CC)
To add CC streaks:
1. Copy `update-ic-streaks.js` → `update-cc-streaks.js`
2. Update competition meta ID to Champions Cup
3. Update season numbers (CC has 5 seasons)
4. Run the script

The streak calculation logic works for any cup competition!
