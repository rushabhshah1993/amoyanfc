## Next Steps

### For Champions Cup
When updating Champions Cup (CC) competition history, use the same approach:
1. Use `finalCupPosition` field
2. Set `divisionNumber` to `null`
3. Set `points` to `null`
4. Update the `update-ic-competition-history.js` script to work for CC

### For Titles
Note: The current update did not populate the `titles` field. This should be updated separately by:
1. Identifying champions (fighters with `finalCupPosition: "Champion"`)
2. Adding entries to `titles.details` array with `competitionSeasonId` and `seasonNumber`
3. Updating `titles.totalTitles` count
