## What Was Implemented

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/pages/VersusPage/VersusPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/VersusPage/VersusPage.css`

**Route**: `/versus/:fighter1Id/:fighter2Id`

### 2. Page Layout

```

### 3. Empty State

│                                         │
│  Fighter1 has not yet fought Fighter2   │
│         in any competitions.            │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┐
```

### 4. Data Structure

**Head-to-Head Data**:
```typescript
interface CompetitionHeadToHead {
    competitionId: string;
    totalFights: number;
    fighter1Wins: number;
    fighter2Wins: number;
    fights: {
        winner: string;
        season: number;
        division?: number;
        round: number;
        fightId: string;
    }[];
}
```

**Data Source**:
- Extracted from `fighter1.opponentsHistory`
- Finds the opponent record matching `fighter2Id`
- Groups fights by `competitionId`
- Calculates win counts automatically

### 5. Navigation Updates

**OpponentsGrid Component**:
- Updated click handler to navigate to versus page
- Changed from: `/fighter/${opponent.id}`

### 🎯 Key Functionality
- Fetches both fighters using GraphQL
- Extracts head-to-head data from `opponentsHistory`
- Groups fights by competition
- Calculates win/loss records automatically
- Displays fight details with season/division/round info

## Data Flow

```
User clicks opponent → Navigate to /versus/:id1/:id2
                          ↓
            Fetch fighter1 + fighter2 (parallel)
                          ↓
    Extract opponentsHistory for fighter2 from fighter1
                          ↓
              Group fights by competitionId
                          ↓
                   Render sections:
                   1. Fighter comparison
                   2. Head-to-head per competition
```

## GraphQL Queries Used

- `GET_FIGHTER_INFORMATION` (called twice, one for each fighter)
- Fetches: `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `profileImage`, `opponentsHistory`

## Usage Example

### From FighterPage
1. User views Fighter A's page
2. Sees opponents grid
3. Clicks on Fighter B (who they've fought)
4. Navigates to `/versus/fighterA-id/fighterB-id`
5. Sees complete head-to-head breakdown

### URL Structure
```
/versus/676d7452eb38b2b97c6da981/676d6ecceb38b2b97c6da945
         └─ Fighter 1 ID ─┘          └─ Fighter 2 ID ─┘
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No fights**: Shows empty state message
2. **Missing fighter**: Shows error message
3. **Loading state**: Shows spinner
4. **Missing images**: Fallback to user icon placeholder
5. **Optional division**: Only shows if exists
6. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Performance

- **Parallel queries**: Both fighters fetched simultaneously
- **Lazy loading**: Fight images use lazy loading
- **Efficient grouping**: Single pass through fight details
- **Memoization**: Could add `useMemo` for fight grouping (future optimization)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
1. **Filter by season**: Show only specific season fights
2. **Statistics comparison**: Side-by-side fighter stats
3. **Timeline view**: Chronological visualization
4. **Fight predictions**: Based on historical data
5. **Share button**: Share head-to-head stats
6. **Export data**: Download as PDF/image
7. **Animation**: Entrance animations for cards
8. **Direct navigation**: Click fight card to see fight details
