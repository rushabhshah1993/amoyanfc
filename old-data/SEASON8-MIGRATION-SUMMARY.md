## Data Structure

The migrated file follows the standard competition schema:

```json
{
  "competitionMetaId": "67780dcc09a4c4b25127f8f6",
  "isActive": false,
  "seasonMeta": {
    "seasonNumber": 8,
    "startDate": "2022-03-08T08:30:37.812Z",
    "endDate": "2022-06-09T04:29:53.506Z",
    "winners": [],
    "leagueDivisions": [...],
    "cupParticipants": { "fighters": [] }
  },
  "leagueData": {
    "divisions": [...]
  }
}
```

## Data Transformations

1. **Fighter IDs**: Converted from old format (e.g., "F034") to MongoDB ObjectIds using fighter-mapping.json
2. **Fight Identifiers**: Preserved original identifiers (e.g., "S8-D1-R1-F1")
3. **Fight Status**: All fights marked as "completed" (winner present) or "pending" (no winner)
4. **Dates**: Preserved original timestamps from source data
5. **Division Structure**: Organized into rounds with proper sequencing

## Validation

✅ All fighter IDs successfully mapped to MongoDB ObjectIds
✅ All 3 divisions processed with correct fighter counts
✅ All rounds and fights preserved with proper identifiers
✅ Start and end dates properly extracted from timeline
✅ Winners identified for all divisions
✅ File structure matches MongoDB schema requirements

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Migration completed - `ifc-season8-migrated.json` created
2. ⏳ Review migrated data file
3. ⏳ Run standings calculation if needed
4. ⏳ Import to MongoDB using `import-season8-to-db.js`
5. ⏳ Verify data in database
6. ⏳ Update competition history for fighters
7. ⏳ Update streaks data for Season 8

## Notes

- Season 8 follows the same structure as Season 7
- All fight data includes proper dates and identifiers
- The migration script can be re-run safely as it overwrites the output file
- Original source files remain unchanged in old-data folder
- Fighter mapping includes all 48 fighters in the system
