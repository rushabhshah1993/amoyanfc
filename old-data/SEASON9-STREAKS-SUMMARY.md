## Date
October 18, 2025

## Overview
Calculated and imported Season 9 streaks data to MongoDB, continuing from active streaks in Season 8 and processing all 231 fights in Season 9.

---

## Streaks Calculation Process

### Data Sources
1. **Season 9 Competition Data**: Loaded from MongoDB
   - 3 divisions
   - 231 total fights
   - 38 fighters

2. **Existing Fighter Streaks**: Loaded from MongoDB
   - Continued active streaks from Season 8
   - All historical streak data maintained

### Calculation Logic

For each fight in Season 9 (processed chronologically):

**Winner Logic:**
- If fighter has active win streak â†’ Extend it (increment count, add opponent)
- If fighter has active lose streak â†’ Close it (set end, active=false) and start new win streak
- If fighter has no active streak â†’ Start new win streak

**Loser Logic:**
- If fighter has active lose streak â†’ Extend it (increment count, add opponent)
- If fighter has active win streak â†’ Close it (set end, active=false) and start new lose streak
- If fighter has no active streak â†’ Start new lose streak

### Streak Structure
```javascript
{
  competitionId: ObjectId,
  type: "win" | "lose",
  start: {
    season: Number,
    division: Number,
    round: Number,
    _id: ObjectId (fight ID)
  },
  end: {
    season: Number,
    division: Number,
    round: Number,
    _id: ObjectId (fight ID)
  } | null,
  count: Number,
  active: Boolean,
  opponents: [ObjectId]
}
```

6. Save results to JSON file

**Output**: `old-data/season9-streaks-updates.json` (708.76 KB)

### 2. import-season9-streaks.js
**Purpose**: Import Season 9 streaks to MongoDB

**Process**:
1. Load streaks data from JSON file
2. Connect to MongoDB
3. For each fighter, replace their entire streaks array
4. Verify import success
5. Show notable streaks
