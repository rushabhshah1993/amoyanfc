## Migration Process

### Step 1: Create Migration Script ‚úÖ
Created `migrate-season10.js` based on Season 10 migration guide template.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Added "IFC-" prefix to all fight identifiers
- ‚úÖ Mapped fighter IDs to MongoDB ObjectIds
- ‚úÖ Preserved fight descriptions where present
- ‚úÖ Set all fights to "completed" status
- ‚úÖ Structured data for MongoDB schema compatibility

### Step 2: Execute Migration ‚úÖ
```bash
cd old-data
node migrate-season10.js
```

**Results:**
```
‚úì Successfully created ifc-season10-migrated.json
  - Season: 10
  - Divisions: 3
  - Total Fights: 231
  - Division 1: 9 rounds, 45 fights
  - Division 2: 11 rounds, 66 fights
  - Division 3: 15 rounds, 120 fights
```

### Step 3: Verification ‚úÖ

**Fight Identifier Format Check:**
```bash
grep -m 5 "fightIdentifier" ifc-season10-migrated.json
```
‚úÖ All fight IDs have correct "IFC-S10-D#-R#-F#" format

**Structure Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Season number: 10
- ‚úÖ Competition Meta ID: 67780dcc09a4c4b25127f8f6
- ‚úÖ isActive: false
- ‚úÖ All 3 divisions present

**Created Import Script:**
```bash
server/scripts/import-season10-to-db.js
```

**Executed Import:**
```bash
node server/scripts/import-season10-to-db.js
```

**Import Results:**
