### ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

#### 1. Season 9 Data Migration

  - Document ID: `68f34bba9e1df8e0f8137afe`
  - 231 fights across 3 divisions
  - All fight identifiers with correct "IFC-" prefix

#### 2. Fight Identifier Prefix Fix

- Season 5: `S5-D1-R1-F1` ‚Üí `IFC-S5-D1-R1-F1`
- Season 6: `S6-D1-R1-F1` ‚Üí `IFC-S6-D1-R1-F1`
- Season 7: `S7-D1-R1-F1` ‚Üí `IFC-S7-D1-R1-F1`

- **Updated:** All 4 JSON files in old-data folder
- **Verified:** All seasons now use consistent format

#### 3. Documentation Created
1. **SEASON9-MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md** - Complete Season 9 migration documentation
2. **FIGHTID-PREFIX-FIX-SUMMARY.md** - Fight ID prefix fix documentation
3. **SEASON10-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for Season 10 (and beyond)

## Key Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing "IFC-" Prefix
**Problem:** Fight identifiers were created without "IFC-" prefix  
**Solution:** Always use `IFC-${fight.id}` when creating fightIdentifier  
**Impact:** Fixed 924 fight IDs across 4 seasons  

### Issue 2: Schema Not Registered
**Problem:** CompetitionMeta model not imported before Competition  
**Solution:** Import order matters - CompetitionMeta first, then Competition  
**Prevention:** Always import CompetitionMeta before Competition in scripts  

### Issue 3: Manual Data Entry
**Problem:** Creating migrated JSON manually is error-prone  
**Solution:** Created automated migration script  
**Benefit:** Faster, more reliable, repeatable process

### Fight ID Updates:
