## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing IFC- Prefix in Fight Identifiers (Prevented)
- **Lesson from Season 9:** Fight identifiers must have `IFC-` prefix
- **Solution:** Added explicit prefix in migration script: `fightIdentifier: \`IFC-${fight.id}\``
- **Status:** ✅ Prevented

### Issue 2: Kanchan Choudhary Missing Competition History
- **Problem:** Kanchan's seasonDetails array was empty after import
- **Cause:** Import script reported 38 updated but only 37 had data
- **Solution:** Created `fix-kanchan-season10.js` to add her Season 10 data
- **Result:** All 38 fighters now have complete Season 10 data
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved

### Issue 3: Active Streaks After Final Season
- **Problem:** 48 fighters had active streaks after Season 10
- **Impact:** Streaks should be closed since IFC is complete
- **Solution:** Created `close-all-active-streaks.js` to:
  - Find each fighter's last fight
  - Close active streaks with proper end context
  - Handle both Season 10 fighters and relegated fighters
- **Result:** 0 remaining active IFC streaks
- **Status:** ✅ Resolved
