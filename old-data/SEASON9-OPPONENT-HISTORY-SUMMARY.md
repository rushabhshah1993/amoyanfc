## Date Completed
October 18, 2025

---

## Phase 1: Calculation

### Script Created
- `server/scripts/calculate-season9-opponent-history.js`

### Source Data
- **MongoDB Competition Document:** Season 9 (Document ID: `68f34bba9e1df8e0f8137afe`)
- **Fighter Data:** `old-data/fighters-old.json`
- **Fighter Mapping:** `old-data/fighter-mapping.json`

### Output File
- **File:** `old-data/season9-opponent-history.json`
- **Size:** 207.09 KB
- **Lines:** ~8,000

### Calculation Results
- ✅ **38 fighters** processed
- ✅ **231 fights** analyzed
- ✅ **462 fighter-opponent pairs** calculated
- ✅ **0 rematches** (each fighter faces each opponent exactly once per division)

### Data Structure
Each fighter's opponent history includes:
```json
{
  "fighterId": "676d6f89eb38b2b97c6da949",
  "fighterName": "Aashna Jogani",
  "fighterCode": "F001",
  "totalOpponents": 15,
  "opponentsHistory": [
    {
      "opponentId": "676d6fc5eb38b2b97c6da94d",
      "totalFights": 1,
      "totalWins": 0,
      "totalLosses": 1,
      "winPercentage": 0,
      "details": [
        {
          "competitionId": "67780dcc09a4c4b25127f8f6",
          "season": 9,
          "divisionId": 3,
          "roundId": 1,
          "fightId": "68f34bba9e1df8e0f8137b92",  // MongoDB ObjectId
          "isWinner": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Fight ObjectIds Included:** Each fight detail contains the MongoDB ObjectId for the fight document
2. **Win Percentage Calculated:** Automatically computed based on wins/total fights
3. **Complete History:** All fights tracked with season, division, and round information
4. **Merge-Ready:** Data structured to merge with existing opponent history from previous seasons

---

## Phase 2: Import to MongoDB

### Script Created
- `server/scripts/import-season9-opponent-history.js`

### Import Strategy
The script uses a **merge** strategy:
1. Load fighter's existing opponent history from database
2. For each opponent:
   - If opponent exists: Add Season 9 fights to existing record, update totals
   - If new opponent: Create new opponent entry
3. Recalculate win percentages
4. Save updated fighter document

### Import Results
✅ **All 38 fighters updated successfully**
- Updated: 38 fighters
- Skipped: 0 fighters
- Errors: 0 fighters

### Data Added
- **Opponent Relationships:** 462 total
- **Fight Records:** 462 fight details added
- **Fighters with Season 9 Data:** 38 (verified in database)

## Notable Characteristics

### Round-Robin Format
Season 9 used a true round-robin format where:
- Each fighter faces every other fighter in their division exactly once
- No rematches within the season
- This is reflected in the data: every opponent entry has `totalFights: 1` for Season 9

### Data Integrity
✅ **All Fight ObjectIds Verified**
- Every fight detail includes the correct MongoDB ObjectId
- ObjectIds can be used to look up full fight details
- Enables the HeadToHead component to display detailed fight information

✅ **Win/Loss Tracking**
- For every fight, both fighters have reciprocal records
- Fighter1's win = Fighter2's loss (and vice versa)
- Win percentages accurately calculated

✅ **Historical Data Preserved**
- Existing opponent history from previous seasons maintained
- Season 9 data merged correctly
- Cumulative stats updated properly

## Use Cases

### 1. Fighter Profiles
Display opponent history on fighter profile pages:
- Total fights against each opponent
- Win/loss record

- Fetch complete fight details
- Display fight date, division, round
- Show fight statistics
- Link to full fight view

### 3. Statistics & Analytics
- Most frequent opponents
- Best/worst head-to-head records

### Query Performance
The opponent history structure supports efficient queries:
```javascript
// Find all opponents of a fighter
Fighter.findById(fighterId).select('opponentsHistory')

// Find specific head-to-head
Fighter.findOne({
  _id: fighterId,
  'opponentsHistory.opponentId': opponentId
})

// Find fighters with Season 9 data
Fighter.find({
  'opponentsHistory.details.season': 9
})
```
