## Import Status
âœ… **SUCCESSFULLY IMPORTED TO MONGODB**

## Notes
- Replaced existing Season 7 data during import (previous incomplete version)
- All fight statuses set to "completed"
- No cup data (cupData: null)
- isActive set to false (historical season)

## Next Steps
If standings data needs to be imported separately, create:
- `import-season7-standings-to-db.js` (similar to Season 6 pattern)

## Verification Commands
```bash
# To verify in MongoDB:
# 1. Check Competition document exists
db.competitions.findOne({ "seasonMeta.seasonNumber": 7 })

# 2. Count total fights
db.competitions.aggregate([
  { $match: { "seasonMeta.seasonNumber": 7 } },
  { $unwind: "$leagueData.divisions" },
  { $unwind: "$leagueData.divisions.rounds" },
  { $unwind: "$leagueData.divisions.rounds.fights" },
  { $count: "totalFights" }
])
```

## Success! ðŸŽ‰
Season 7 is now live in the database and ready for use in the application.
