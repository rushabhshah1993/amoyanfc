# Season 7 Competition History - Calculation & Import Summary

## Overview
Successfully calculated and imported IFC Season 7 competition history data to MongoDB fighter documents.

## Date
January 27, 2025

## Process

### 1. Data Calculation
- **Source Data:**
  - `ifc-season7-migrated.json` - Season 7 competition data with all fights
  - `ifc-season7-season.json` - Final positions and season metadata
  - `fighters-old.json` - Fighter names
  - `fighter-mapping.json` - Fighter code to ObjectId mapping

- **Output File:**
  - `season7-competition-history.json` - Competition statistics for all 38 fighters

- **Calculation Script:**
  - `server/scripts/calculate-season7-competition-history.js`
  - Processes each fight and tracks wins/losses for each fighter
  - Calculates points (3 per win)
  - Calculates win percentages
  - Includes final positions from season data

### 2. Competition History Structure

Each fighter's competition history entry contains:

```javascript
competitionHistory: [
  {
    competitionId: ObjectId,                    // IFC competition ID
    numberOfSeasonAppearances: Number,          // Total seasons participated
    totalFights: Number,                        // Total fights across all seasons
    totalWins: Number,                          // Total wins across all seasons
    totalLosses: Number,                        // Total losses across all seasons
    winPercentage: Number,                      // Overall win percentage
    seasonDetails: [
      {
        seasonNumber: 7,                        // Season number
        divisionNumber: Number,                 // Division (1, 2, or 3)
        fights: Number,                         // Fights in this season
        wins: Number,                           // Wins in this season
        losses: Number,                         // Losses in this season
        points: Number,                         // Points earned (wins Ã— 3)
        winPercentage: Number,                  // Win % for this season
        finalPosition: Number                   // Final ranking in division
      },
      // ... other seasons
    ]
  }
]
```

### 3. Data Merging Strategy
The import script:
- Finds or creates competition history entry for IFC
- Checks if Season 7 already exists in seasonDetails
- If exists: subtracts old stats, replaces with new data
- If new: adds Season 7 to seasonDetails array
- Updates overall statistics (totalFights, totalWins, totalLosses, numberOfSeasonAppearances)
- Recalculates overall winPercentage

### 4. Verification
- âœ… All 38 fighters processed
- âœ… Basic structure validated
- âœ… Fight counts correct per division (10, 12, 16 fighters)
- âœ… All Division 1 fighters: 9 fights each
- âœ… All Division 2 fighters: 11 fights each  
- âœ… All Division 3 fighters: 15 fights each
- âœ… Wins + Losses = Total Fights for all fighters
- âœ… Points = Wins Ã— 3 for all fighters
- âœ… Win percentages calculated correctly
- âœ… Final positions validated (sequential, no duplicates)
- âœ… Division winners verified

### 5. MongoDB Import
- **Import Script:** `server/scripts/import-season7-competition-history.js`
- **NPM Command:** `npm run import:season7:competition-history`
- **Model:** Fighter (competitionHistory field)
- **Update Method:** Merge with existing competition history
