## Calculation Process

### Step 1: Load Required Data âœ…
- Loaded Season 10 migrated competition data
- Loaded Season 10 standings data (231 snapshots)

- Wins: 0
- Losses: 0
- Points: 0

3. Update fighter1 statistics:
   - Increment total fights
   - If winner: increment wins, add 3 points
   - If loser: increment losses
   - Recalculate win percentage
4. Update fighter2 statistics (same logic)

- Division 1: Round 9, Fight 5 (`IFC-S10-D1-R9-F5`)
- Division 2: Round 11, Fight 6 (`IFC-S10-D2-R11-F6`)
- Division 3: Round 15, Fight 8 (`IFC-S10-D3-R15-F8`)

Mapped final positions to all 38 fighters.

### Step 5: Save and Verify âœ…

- Verified data structure and calculations
- Confirmed all 38 fighters processed

### Step 6: Import to MongoDB âœ…
- Connected to MongoDB database

  - `totalFights` += Season 10 fights
  - `totalWins` += Season 10 wins
  - `totalLosses` += Season 10 losses
  - `winPercentage` recalculated
  - `numberOfSeasonAppearances` incremented
- Verified import in database
