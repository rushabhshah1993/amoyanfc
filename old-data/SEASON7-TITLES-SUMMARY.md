    titles: {
      totalTitles: Number,                      // Count of championships
      details: [
        {
          competitionSeasonId: ObjectId,        // Season 7 competition document ID
          seasonNumber: 7,                      // Season number
          divisionNumber: 1 | 2 | 3            // Division won
