# Season 7 Streaks - Calculation & Import Summary

## Overview
Successfully calculated and imported IFC Season 7 streaks data to MongoDB fighter documents. The streaks continue from Season 6 active streaks and maintain continuity across all seasons.

## Date
January 27, 2025

## Process

### 1. Data Calculation
- **Source Data:**
  - Current fighter documents from MongoDB (with Season 6 active streaks)
  - `ifc-season7-migrated.json` - Season 7 competition data with all fights

- **Output File:**
  - `season7-streaks-updates.json` - Complete streaks data for all 38 Season 7 fighters

- **Calculation Script:**
  - `server/scripts/calculate-season7-streaks.js`
  - Loads existing streaks from MongoDB
  - Processes each Season 7 fight chronologically
  - Updates active streaks or creates new streaks based on fight results
  - Maintains streak continuity from previous seasons

### 2. Streaks Structure

Each fighter's streaks array contains streak objects:

```javascript
streaks: [
  {
    competitionId: ObjectId,                // IFC competition ID
    type: "win" | "lose",                   // Type of streak
    start: {                                // Where streak started
      season: Number,
      division: Number,
      round: Number
    },
    end: {                                  // Where streak ended (null if active)
      season: Number,
      division: Number,
      round: Number
    } | null,
    count: Number,                          // Number of consecutive results
    active: Boolean,                        // Is this streak currently active
    opponents: [ObjectId]                   // Array of opponent IDs in this streak
  },
  // ... more streaks
]
```

### 3. Streak Logic

For each fight with Fighter 1 vs Fighter 2:

#### If Fighter 1 Wins:
- **Has active win streak?**
  - YES: Increment count, add opponent ID to opponents array
  - NO: Close active lose streak (if any), create new win streak

#### If Fighter 1 Loses:
- **Has active lose streak?**
  - YES: Increment count, add opponent ID to opponents array
  - NO: Close active win streak (if any), create new lose streak

The same logic applies to Fighter 2.

### 4. Continuity from Previous Seasons

- Season 6 ended with each fighter having an active streak (win or lose)
- Season 7 calculation starts with these active streaks
- Streaks either continue or are broken based on first fight result
- Active streaks can span multiple seasons

**Example:**
```javascript
// Fighter had active win streak from S6
{
  type: "win",
  start: { season: 6, division: 1, round: 5 },
  end: null,
  count: 5,  // 3 wins in S6 + 2 wins in S7
  active: true,
  opponents: [
    "opponent1_from_s6",
    "opponent2_from_s6", 
    "opponent3_from_s6",
    "opponent1_from_s7",  // Season 7 continues the streak
    "opponent2_from_s7"
  ]
}
```

### 5. Verification
- ‚úÖ All 38 fighters processed
- ‚úÖ Each fighter has exactly 1 active streak
- ‚úÖ Streak types alternate correctly (win ‚Üí lose ‚Üí win)
- ‚úÖ Streak counts match opponents array lengths
- ‚úÖ Active streaks have null end, inactive streaks have valid end
- ‚úÖ Continuity verified across seasons
- ‚úÖ 213 new streaks started in Season 7
- ‚úÖ 211 streaks ended in Season 7
- ‚úÖ 38 streaks remain active after Season 7

### 6. MongoDB Import
- **Import Script:** `server/scripts/import-season7-streaks.js`
- **NPM Command:** `npm run import:season7:streaks`
- **Model:** Fighter (streaks field)
- **Update Method:** Complete replacement of streaks array

## Season 7 Streaks Statistics

### Overall
- **Total Fighters:** 38
- **Total Fights:** 231
- **Streaks Started:** 213
- **Streaks Ended:** 211
- **Active Streaks After S7:** 38

### Active Streaks Distribution
- **Active Win Streaks:** 19 fighters
- **Active Lose Streaks:** 19 fighters
- **Balance:** Perfect 50/50 split

### Longest Streaks
- **Longest Active Win Streak:** 10 fights (Ishita Shah)
- **Longest Active Lose Streak:** 5 fights (Krishi Punamiya)

### Streak Patterns

Streaks demonstrate natural fighter performance patterns:
- Some fighters maintain long win streaks (10+ fights)
- Some fighters struggle with lose streaks (5+ fights)
- Most fighters alternate between short streaks (1-3 fights)
- Streaks provide momentum visualization across seasons

## Data Integrity

### Continuity Checks
- ‚úÖ No gaps between consecutive streaks
- ‚úÖ Streak types alternate correctly
- ‚úÖ Previous streak's end = next streak's start
- ‚úÖ Active streaks from S6 properly extended or closed

### Validation
- ‚úÖ Every active streak has `end: null`
- ‚úÖ Every inactive streak has valid end object
- ‚úÖ Count equals opponents array length for all streaks
- ‚úÖ No duplicate active streaks per fighter
- ‚úÖ All opponent IDs are valid ObjectIds
