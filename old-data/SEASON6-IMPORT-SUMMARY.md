## Technical Details

### Fight Identifier Format
Season 6 uses: `S6-D{division}-R{round}-F{fight}`
- Example: `S6-D1-R1-F1` (Division 1, Round 1, Fight 1)
- Example: `S6-D3-R15-F9` (Division 3, Round 15, Fight 9)

### Tiebreaker Logic
Applied when fighters have equal points:
1. **Head-to-head points** (among tied fighters only)
2. **Fighter first name** (alphabetical order)

### Notable Data Points
- **Null Fight:** Division 3, Round 14 had 1 null fight (properly filtered)
- **Makeup Fight:** Division 3, Round 15 had 9 fights (extra makeup fight)
- **Fighter Names:** All 38 fighters have proper names from MongoDB
- **Date Format:** All dates preserved as ISO 8601 strings

| 2 | 1 | 10 | 9 | 45 | 45 | Earlier |
| 3 | 1 | 10 | 9 | 45 | 45 | Earlier |
| 4 | 3 | 38 | 35 | 231 | 231 | Earlier |
| 5 | 3 | 38 | 35 | 285 | 285 | Earlier |
