**For the Winner:**
1. Check if they have an active win streak
   - If YES: Increment count, add opponent to opponents array
   - If NO: 
     - Close any active lose streak (set active=false, add end data)
     - Create new win streak (set active=true, add start data, add opponent)

**For the Loser:**
1. Check if they have an active lose streak
   - If YES: Increment count, add opponent to opponents array
   - If NO:
     - Close any active win streak (set active=false, add end data)
     - Create new lose streak (set active=true, add start data, add opponent)

### Step 4: Save and Verify ✅
- Saved updated streaks for all 38 Season 10 fighters
- Verified data structure
- Confirmed active streaks
- Checked continuation from Season 9

### Step 5: Import to MongoDB ✅
- Connected to MongoDB

## Technical Notes

### Streak Logic
1. **Fighter Wins:**
   - Has active win streak? → Increment count, add opponent
   - Has active lose streak? → Close it, start new win streak
   - No active streak? → Start new win streak

2. **Fighter Loses:**
   - Has active lose streak? → Increment count, add opponent
   - Has active win streak? → Close it, start new lose streak
   - No active streak? → Start new lose streak

### Data Integrity
- All streaks have start context (season/division/round/fightId)
- Closed streaks have end context
- Active streaks have end: null
- Opponent IDs match fighter IDs in database
- Fight IDs match MongoDB ObjectIds

### Performance
- Calculation time: < 10 seconds
- Import time: < 30 seconds
- File size: 790 KB
- Database updates: 38 documents
- Zero errors or failures
