# Season 9 Competition History - Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the calculation and import of Season 9 competition history data to MongoDB.

## Competition History Structure
Each fighter's competition history includes:
- `fighterId`: MongoDB ObjectId
- `fighterName`: Full name
- `fighterCode`: Fighter code (e.g., F001)
- `divisionNumber`: Division participated in
- `fights`: Total fights in Season 9
- `wins`: Total wins in Season 9
- `losses`: Total losses in Season 9
- `points`: Total points earned (3 per win)
- `winPercentage`: Win percentage for Season 9
- `finalPosition`: Final ranking in division

## Scripts Created

### 1. Calculate Competition History
**File**: `server/scripts/calculate-season9-competition-history.js`

**Purpose**: Calculate Season 9 competition statistics for all fighters

**Process**:
1. Load Season 9 migrated data (`ifc-season9-migrated.json`)
2. Load Season 9 standings data (`season9-all-rounds-standings.json`)
3. Load fighter mapping data
4. Initialize stats for all 38 Season 9 fighters
5. Process all fights (231 total) across 3 divisions:
   - Division 1: 45 fights (9 rounds)
   - Division 2: 66 fights (11 rounds)
   - Division 3: 120 fights (15 rounds)
6. For each completed fight:
   - Increment `totalFights` for both fighters
   - Increment `wins` for winner, `losses` for loser
   - Add 3 points to winner
   - Calculate win percentage
7. Extract final positions from standings data
8. Save to `season9-competition-history.json`

**Output File**: `old-data/season9-competition-history.json` (10.05 KB)

### 2. Import Competition History to MongoDB
**File**: `server/scripts/import-season9-competition-history.js`

**Purpose**: Import Season 9 competition history to fighter documents

**Process**:
1. Connect to MongoDB
2. Load competition history JSON file
3. Verify Season 9 competition exists in database
4. For each fighter:
   - Find or create `competitionHistory` entry for IFC
   - Add Season 9 to `seasonDetails` array
   - Update aggregate statistics:
     - `numberOfSeasonAppearances` (increment by 1)
     - `totalFights` (add Season 9 fights)
     - `totalWins` (add Season 9 wins)
     - `totalLosses` (add Season 9 losses)
     - `winPercentage` (recalculate overall)
5. Save updated fighter documents
6. Verify import success
