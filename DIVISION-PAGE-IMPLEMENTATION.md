## Technical Details

### Tiebreaker Logic
Standings are sorted using sophisticated tiebreaking:
1. **Primary**: Total points (descending)
2. **Secondary**: Head-to-head points among tied fighters (descending)
3. **Tertiary**: Alphabetical by first name (ascending)

### Data Flow
```
User selects Round 3
    â†“
GraphQL Query: getRoundStandingsByRound(competitionId, seasonNumber, divisionNumber, roundNumber: 3)
    â†“
Backend finds last fight of Round 3 (e.g., "IFC-S1-D1-R3-F5")
    â†“
Returns cumulative standings after all Round 3 fights
    â†“
Frontend displays:
  - Standings table (season cumulative up to Round 3)
  - All 5 fights from Round 3
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop (>1200px)**: Side-by-side layout
- **Tablet (768px-1200px)**: Stacked layout
- **Mobile (<768px)**: 
  - Stacked layout
  - Smaller images
  - Simplified fighter cards
